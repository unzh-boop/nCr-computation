# nCr computation
Write a C++ program to compute the nCr

In permutations and combinations, the term *nCr* refers to *n* combinations taken *r* at a time.
 
nCr=n!/r!(n-r)!

- Write a recursive function to find the factorial of a number.
- Use the defined function to compute the term *nCr* for the following scenario:
- The values of "*n*" and "*r*" are stored in two parallel arrays of any user defined size.
- You have to read the arrays n and r at runtime. Compute nCr for each corresponding term n and r and store it in another separate array and display the output array properly formatted.
- Also, your program should print the current system date and time using the library functions.
